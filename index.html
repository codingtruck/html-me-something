                <p class = "paragraph">Aruba is another island country under the Netherlands. It is a part of the ABC Dutch islands along with Curacao and Bonaire. Aruba is the closest to the Venezuela mainland. There are white sand beaches that dot the island but some of the areas look like desert landscape. Historic atractions are a huge draw of tourism notably the natural bridge made of limestone and the Bushiribana Ruins on the islands east side. Another tourist atraction is the California Lighthouse on the northern tip where you can look out over the island and enjoy authentic smoothies from the vendors that set up shop.</p>
